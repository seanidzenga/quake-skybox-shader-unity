# Quake Skybox Shader for Unity
The usage of this shader is pretty simple, you will find a quick example in this repository. It is highly encouraged to combine this shader with CSG tools.

Disclaimer: Even though the shader works and is highly parametrizable, I'm not a proficient shader writer, so maybe you can find a way to improve the code or make it more performant.
